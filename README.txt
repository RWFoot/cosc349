Usage Instructions 
To run my three VMâ€™s you will need to install the latest version of Vagrant and VirtualBox which are both linked to below. 
Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads
VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

You will then need to make a clone of my git repository which can be done by using the terminal or by downloading an archived zip folder of all of its contents. Instructions are shown below for both these methods. 

1. Terminal Method
Type into your terminal window this command: 
git clone https://github.com/AlexLakeSmith/349-Assignment-1.git

2. Download contents as a .zip  
Type the following into your browser window: https://github.com/AlexLakeSmith/349-Assignment-1/archive/main.zip
Once this has been done you then navigate to the directory the repository has been cloned/downloaded to and enter the command: 	vagrant up

You can then access the front facing website which can be used to query current songs in the playlist by searching the following address in your browser:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/

You can alternatively access the back facing website which can be used to add new songs to the music database at the following address: 
http://127.0.0.1:8081/
